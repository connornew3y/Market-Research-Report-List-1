<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas Trucks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CNG Trucks</li><li>LNG Trucks</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The natural gas trucks market primarily consists of two types: CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) trucks and LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) trucks. CNG trucks utilize compressed natural gas stored at high pressures, making them suitable for short to medium-range applications, such as urban deliveries. In contrast, LNG trucks employ liquefied natural gas, which is more efficient for long-haul transportation due to its higher energy density and extended driving range. Both types contribute to reduced emissions and offer cost advantages over diesel alternatives.</p></p>
